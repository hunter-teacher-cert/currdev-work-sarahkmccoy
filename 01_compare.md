Topic: Comparing Intro to CS standards

Standards being compared: 
[Introduction to Programming with Java](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csjava/index.html?mode=browsing)

#### Major differences:
   - Coding language: My current curriculum makes use of Python in the Project Stem's CodeSkultor IDE
- Interteractive ability: Both curriculums are interactive in their own ways.
  - In my curriculum the use of GUI makes it more fun.
  - The java curriculum had small code examples and interactive exercises in the text itself
- Use of PLB:
  - My curriculum is structured with introductory lessons on topics and then projects where students practice applying coding topics in a project
  - The java curriculum introduces topics and does a nice job of giving small contained examples of concepts but a poor job of providing meaning for the concepts with more complex project applying the concept. 

#### Major similiarities:
- Topics covered are very similar
- Make good use of functions/method and classes to create complex data structures

#### Comparative streangths & weaknesses: 
- Covered in the major differences section

#### Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?
- I am not sure because while I value students learning Java more than Python, to keep consistency across our CS track, I think java would be difficult for a potential first language.  It does not use as human friendly language, and has much more compiling erros.  I like the scaffolding and non-code examples of the Java text but do not like the lack of larger coding projects that I think make a programming class more meaningful. I like my current curriculum better but I think both need more of an emphasis on non-code related computer science topics!
