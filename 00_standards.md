# 9-12.NSD.4
## Describe the components and design characteristics that allow data and information to be moved, stored and referenced over the Internet.
### Clarifying Statement
The focus is on understanding the design decisions that direct the coordination among systems composing the Internet that allow for scalability and reliability. Discussions should consider historical, cultural, and economic decisions related to the development of the Internet, as well as the core components of servers and routers
### Activity - Human TCP/IP
Goal: For students to successfully send their word to their “receiver” (partner), and to receive their partner’s word.

Students each receive a paper strip with a word on it. They cut this word along black lines into single letters, and on the back side of each letter, they write the destination IP address of their partner (consisting of a table number and seat number).

Without moving from their seats, students send (pass) or receive only one packet (letter) at a time. They may hand one (and only one) piece of paper at a time to any person who is within arm’s reach. If students receive a piece of paper that is not for them, they pass it along.

If a student's IP Address gets called out as a “faulty node,” they must immediately put their hands down and stop passing until their node gets “fixed”!

Finally, students collect all their pieces and reconstruct the word. The words are all anagrams of other words, so it’s very possible (and intentional) that students make the wrong word, or if missing a packet, form a smaller but valid word with the received letters
